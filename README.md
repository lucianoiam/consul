*Control Surface Library*

This is a VST 2/3 plugin that provides a web user interface for controlling other plugins supporting MIDI learn. The user interface is primarily designed for touch devices. The plugin is self-contained and no additional software is required; just drop it into the same chain (and before) the target plugin.

Example use case: tweak Amplitube parameters from a Wi-Fi tablet.

Current development status:

- Backend : complete
- Frontend : complete
- Documentation : null for the moment

Known bugs: VST3 not working on Ableton Live (VST2 on this DAW).
